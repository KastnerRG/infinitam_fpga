Clumsy attempt at providing an Android build environment for the project

  InfiniTAM



To make it build:

  - Create a file named 'local.properties' with the content:

    sdk.dir=/path/to/your/local/android/android-sdk-linux



To get it to build in release mode:

  - Create a keystore:

    keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name \
            -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

  - Tell the build environment about your keystore by adding the following into
    a file named 'ant.properties':

    key.store=my-release-key.keystore
    key.alias=alias_name
    key.store.password=xxx
    key.alias.password=xxx



To actually build it:

  - Go to the directory InfiniTAM/ITMLib and run

    make -f Android.mk libITMLib.a

  - Go back to the directory InfiniTAM/android and run

    ndk-build

  - Stay in the directory InfiniTAM/android and run

    ant release install



To get OpenNI running:

  - Get the latest sources, go to OpenNI2/Packaging and run

    ./ReleaseVersion.py android

  - Hope and pray that the libusb issues have been fixed! There are
    tremendous problems with actually accessing a device under all recent
    Android versions (4.4 and 5.0 at least)



To complain:

  - Don't contact me!
