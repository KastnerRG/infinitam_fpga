1. Add KNOB for enabling/disabling interpolation for point and normal
2. Simplify mat-vec multiplications (matVecMul).
3. Inverse intrinsics to avoid division.
4. Remove unnecessary initialization to 0 for localHessian / localNabla.
4. POTENTIAL KNOB: Moving localHessian / localNabla / A outside of the loop seems to consistently increase logic/memory utilization. Not done for now.
5. Work on a local copy of sumNabla / sumHessian / sumF / noValidPoints.
6. Add KNOB to unroll Hessian / Nabla calculation.
7. Add KNOB to remove some branches related to shortIterations (except when filling array A).
8. Add KNOB to unroll sum Nabla and Hessian.
9. Added shift register for sum Nabla, and added that option to previous KNOB.
10. Added shift register for sum Hessian, and added that option to previous KNOB.
11. Added shift register for sumF when either sum Nabla or sum Hessian is using shift register.
12. Flatten X and Y loop to index XY. Keep X and Y and increment them conditionally.
13. Replaced continue with nested if statements.
14. Replaced the loop by work-items, with pipes and a second kernel to accumulate.
