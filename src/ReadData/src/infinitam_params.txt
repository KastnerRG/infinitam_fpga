- device_type  : cpu, gpu, opencl

- opencl_device: cpu, gpu, fpga

- opencl_algo: 0 (Scene Integration), 1 (Raycasting), 2 (Integration + Raycasting kernels), 3 (Combined kernel), 4 (ICP), 5 (Integration + Raycast + ICP), 6 (Combined + ICP)
Note: #2 uses 2 different AOCX on FPGA, #5 and #6 use a single AOCX on FPGA

- tracker_type: color, icp, ren, imu, imu_only, wicp, imu_init

- no_hierarchy_levels: < 1 (use default), 1, 2, 3, ...

- tracking_regime: default (only if levels is < 1), both_only, translation_only, rotation_only, both_translation, both_rotation
  ('both' means translation+rotation combined, '_only' means for all levels, 'both_rotation' means half levels both and half rotation)

- headless: 0 (UI), 1 (headless or network client)

- blocking: 0 (read data in parallel of processing), 1 (wait until data are processed to read next)

- client_address: network address, or "server" if you activate the --server option and want to get the address from any client that connects to the server
