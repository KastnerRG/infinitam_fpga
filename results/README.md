# Results

The directories `de1` and `de5` contain CSV files with results for all the designs of one bitstream. The files contain:

* Knob values (knobs may have a slightly different name, but are in the same order as in the source code),
* FPGA resource utilization,
* Running time measurements (ignore columns with 0),
* ATE (for TUM benchmarks only).

The Jupyter notebooks contain scripts to parse, analyze, and plot these data.
